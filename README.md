# Git for Humans

An Intuitive [Git](https://git-scm.com/) Commands for Humans

## Introduction

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is cool. It makes teamwork and collaborations easy.

But have you ever have to type unnecessary long commands like the following (only to start using Git in your new project):

```shell
git init 
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

Or when you need to face another long commands for publishing some changes into a remote repository:

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "Add publish function"
git remote add origin https://github.com/git4humans/git4humans 
git push origin main
```

Using **Git for Humans**, the above two scenarios can be done in a more succinct way (and let the tool guide you in a more friendly way):

```shell 
gt start 
```

```shell 
gt publish
```

The basic principle of **Git for Humans** is conventions over configurations.

Another principle is interactivity and guidance.
